# NeuralNetwork1.1
Inspired by a video of one my favorite Youtubers (Sebastian Lague) I want to build a neural network myself without relying on the ever so popular libraries, that do all the heavy lifting without any chance to lift the curtains to see what the machine is actually doing. 
This project is irregularly updated
Current state: learning routine written, Neural Network Class works, Next: implement exact derivatives for more efficient backpropagation (until now only finite differences)
